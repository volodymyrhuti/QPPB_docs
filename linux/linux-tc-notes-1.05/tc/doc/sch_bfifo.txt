The bfifo queuing discipline
----------------------------

Parameters.

  limit NUMBER
    This is maximum number of bytes that can be on this queue.
    Enqueuing a packet when the queue is at or above this limit
    causes the packet to be dropped.  A packet will be sent 
    provided it is enqueued when the queue is below this limit,
    even if adding the packet will take the queue above this
    limit.  If not specified this parameter defaults to the queue
    length of the underlying device multiplied by the maximum
    transmission unit for the device.  These are the qlen and mtu
    parameters printed by "ip link list".

Classes.  The bfifo queuing discipline does not have classes.
The packets are sent in the order they are received.

Scheduling.  The bfifo queuing discipline has not have a scheduler.

Policing.  Enqueuing a packet when the queue already contains, or
has more than, the number of bytes defined by the limit parameter
will cause the packet to be dropped.

Rate limiting.  The bfifo queuing discipline does not rate limit
traffic.

Classifier.  The bfifo queuing discipline does not classify packets.


Comments.

- bfifo polices the length of the queue, ensuring it does not grow
  beyond the maximum limit defined by it parameter.  That is all it
  does.
