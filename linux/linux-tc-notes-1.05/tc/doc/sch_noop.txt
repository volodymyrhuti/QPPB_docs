  discipline to a device or class.

  created and the device's link state (as printed by "ip link list")
  is down.  When the link state is changed to up the noop queuing
  discipline, if still present, is replaced by a pfifo_fast or noqueue
  queuing discipline.

- Yes, the noop queuing discipline really does drop, delete and discard
  all packets queued onto it.
