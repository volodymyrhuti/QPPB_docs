The IPChains fwmark classifier
------------------------------

Handles.

  The handle for the fwmark is the "fwmark" set by ipchains
  or iptables.  Like all filter handles it must be unique.

Execution.

  The fwmark filter finds filter item whose handle equals
  the "fwmark" value ipchains or iptables set for the packet.
  If the filter item is found the packet is classified,
  otherwise not.

  Be warned that the fwmark currently (2.4.9) uses a primitive
  hash table to do the searching.  The hash table is 256 bytes
  long, and the "hash function" just extracts the eight least
  significant bits.  So don't use fwmark's that differ by
  largish powers of 2.

Options.

  classid :<classify-spec>: | flowid :<classify-spec>:
    This is required.  It :classifies: the packet.

  police :<police-spec>:
    :Police: the packet.

Comments.

  IPChains is the most powerful packet recognition engine
  available in the kernel, and using it to set "fwmark" is a
  relatively straight forward job.  "fwmark" is the easiest
  classifier to use by far.  It is a unique combination - use
  it where you can.
