The QoS Policy Propagation via BGP feature allows you to classify packets by IP precedence based on the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community lists, BGP autonomous system paths, access lists, thus helping to
classify based on destination instead of source address.

After packets have been classified, you can use other quality of service (QoS) features such as committed
access rate (CAR) and Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) to specify and enforce policies to fit your
business model.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On a large and complex network, a large number of MF (Multi-Field) classification operations are required,
and routes cannot be classified based on the community attribute, ACL, IP prefix, or AS_Path.
When a network topology keeps changing, configuring or changing routing policies is difficult or even
impossible to implement. Therefore, the QPPB is introduced to reduce configuration workload by configuring
or changing routing policies only on a BGP route sender.

QPPB is implemented as follows:
- Before sending BGP routes, a route sender sets a specific attribute, such as the AS_Path,
  community attribute, or extended community attribute, for BGP routes.
  These attributes are used to identify BGP routes.  
- After receiving the BGP routes, a route receiver performs the following operations:
  1. Maps each received BGP route to a QoS local ID, an IP preference and traffic behavior
     based on the AS_Path, community attribute, or extended community attribute.
  2. Performs different traffic behaviors for packets transmitted along the routes according
     to their mapped QoS local IDs, IP preference and traffic behavior.
     A route receiver can define traffic behaviors for the packets transmitted along the
     routes based on the following attributes:
     – ACL
     – AS-Path list
     – Community attribute list
     – Route cost
     – IP prefix list
     - etc ...
3. Creates a QPPB local policy and define the mappings between BGP routes and QoS policies in it.
4. Apply the QPPB local policy to all packets that meet the matching rules on interfaces.

Cisco has worked hard over the years to streamline the process of table lookup in the routing table, to
reduce per-packet processing for the forwarding process, QPPB can use this same efficient table-lookup
process to reduce classification and marking overhead.

CEF optimizes forwarding by creating a new table that includes entries for the routes in the routing
table. This table is called the Forwarding Information Base (FIB). The FIB optimizes the process of
locating a route by performing a table lookup in the FIB rather than the less- efficient table lookup
of the routing table. In other words, CEF switching crunches the routing table into the FIB, and then
uses the FIB to make the forwarding decisions. (This in itself is somewhat of an oversimplification
of CEF; for more detail, refer to Vijay Bollapragada’s Inside Cisco IOS Software Architecture [Cisco Press, 2000].)

CEF optimizes the creation of new data-link headers by creating a table that contains the new data-
link header associated with each next-hop IP address in the FIB. By doing so, when FIB table lookup
is complete, the header can be added to the packet with little processing.
When QPPB marks a route, it actually marks either or both of the two fields inside each entry in the
FIB. The FIB contains IP precedence and QoS group fields in order to support QPPB. Therefore,
when CEF crunches the routing table to create FIB entries, when QPPB is configured, the
appropriate FIB precedence and QoS group fields are set.

What are CoS, COS, ToS, Diffserv, DSCP, DS? (brief explanation, one sentence per acronym will be enough)

CoS - Is a 3-bit field that operates only on VLAN tagged Ethernet at the data link layer (layer 2).
The field specifies a priority value, that can be used by quality of service (QoS) disciplines to
differentiate and shape/police network traffic.

COS - Related to legacy telephone systems, COS can define permissions for voice traffic.

ToS - Second byte of the IPv4 header. Also referred to as the differentiated services field (DS field)
which consists of a 6-bit Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field and a 2-bit
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field.

Diffserv - Operates at the IP network layer (layer 3), is a new model for quality of service control.
Packets are individually classified and marked; policy decisions are made independently by each node in a path.
(see IntServ - Integrated Services)

DSCP - The first six bits of the IP TOS are evaluated to provide more granular classification;
backward-compatible with IP Precedence

DS - The DiffServ architecture defines the DiffServ (DS) field, which supersedes the ToS field in IPv4
to make per-hop behavior (PHB) decisions about packet classification and traffic conditioning functions,
such as metering, marking, shaping, and policing.
